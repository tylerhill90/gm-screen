# GM Screen
GM Screen is a simple website for a Game Master (GM) to keep track of Player Character (PC) stats in multiple Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaigns. It features a dynamic initiative tracker to quickly order PCs and monsters in combat.

This tool was made as my final project for Harvard's free online computer science course, CS50.
